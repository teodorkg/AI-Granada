# Second homework
The homework task detailes can be found in the pdf files in Spanish.
In general the task is to implement Uniform cost search, A*.
Additionally strategies and estimate cost functions should be elaborated.
It is all done in the concepts of a funny game where our hero should reach points on a map that has obstacles and different surfaces.
He has his vision and memory. Sometimes he knows the whole map and his exact position. 
And other times he has to encounter special points on the map that will reveal his position on the map and then he can reconstruct the map while reaching his goals. :)
